# SPDX tools-golang

`tools-golang` is a collection of Go packages intended to make it easier for
Go programs to work with [SPDXÂ®](https://spdx.dev/) files.

## What it does

tools-golang currently works with files conformant to versions 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3
of the SPDX specification, available at: https://spdx.dev/specifications

tools-golang provides the following packages:

* *spdx* - in-memory data model for the sections of an SPDX document
* *tagvalue* - tag-value document reader and writer
* *rdf* - RDF document reader
* *json* - JSON document reader and writer
* *yaml* - YAML document reader and writer
* *builder* - builds "empty" SPDX document (with hashes) for directory contents
* *idsearcher* - searches for [SPDX short-form IDs](https://spdx.org/ids/) and builds an SPDX document
* *licensediff* - compares concluded licenses between files in two packages
* *reporter* - generates basic license count report from an SPDX document
* *spdxlib* - various utility functions for manipulating SPDX documents in memory
* *utils* - various utility functions that support the other tools-golang packages

Examples for how to use these packages can be found in the `examples/`
directory.

## What it doesn't do

`tools-golang` doesn't currently support files under any version of the SPDX spec prior to v2.1

## Documentation

SPDX tools-golang documentation is available on the pkg.go.dev website at https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/spdx/tools-golang.
